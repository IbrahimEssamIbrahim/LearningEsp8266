# IoT Learning Journey with ESP8266

This repository contain the files that i collected during my journey into IoT using the ESP8266. I began with simple sketches like blinking an LED and analog read to understand the differences between the ESP8266 and Arduino once i got the basics done. Gradually, I explored more advanced features of esp's WiFi capabilities such as web access, interface design, data fetching from websites, and interacting with Google services, which are demonstrated in subsequent projects.

one of the playlists that realy helped me was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfgCIULRQavyhr5eZssPgJa36n3A6b7MM">Eng Mohamed Yousef محمد يوسف</a> playlist about IoT - NodeMCU (ESP8266).
